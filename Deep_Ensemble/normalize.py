        This is the forward transformation function which transforms the
        trajectories to a square region around the origin such as
        [-1,-1] - [1,1] while the original trajectories could be in
        pixel unit or in metres. The transformation would be applied
        to the trajectories as follows:
          new_trajectories = (old_trajectories - shift) / scale

               Ntrajectories x Ntime_step x 2D_x_y

               If not given, the centroid of trajectory points
               would be used.
        :param scale: the desirable scale factor. If not given, the scale
              would be computed so that the trajectory points fall inside
              the [-1,-1] to [1,1] region.

                transformation.

                supplied, then the function computes and returns them.

        are given or they are all not given.
